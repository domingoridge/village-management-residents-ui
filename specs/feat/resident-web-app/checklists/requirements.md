# Specification Quality Checklist: Village Management Resident Web Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is ready for the next phase.

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality** - PASSED

- Specification focuses on user needs and business value
- Written in non-technical language suitable for stakeholders
- No mention of React, TypeScript, or specific frameworks
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness** - PASSED

- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (made informed guesses based on industry standards)
- 81 functional requirements, all testable and specific
- 28 success criteria, all measurable and technology-agnostic
- 9 user stories with acceptance scenarios
- 10 edge cases identified
- Clear scope with 9 prioritized user stories (P1-P5)
- Comprehensive assumptions section documenting reasonable defaults

**Feature Readiness** - PASSED

- Each user story has 5-6 specific acceptance scenarios
- User stories prioritized from P1 (Guest Pre-Authorization) to P5 (Communication)
- Success criteria include user adoption, feature usage, performance, satisfaction, reliability, and business impact metrics
- All success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "Users can complete payment in under 3 minutes" not "API response time")

## Notes

The specification successfully translates comprehensive business requirements into a clear, testable specification without any implementation details. All reasonable defaults were applied based on:

- Industry-standard web application practices
- Modern browser capabilities
- Common UX patterns for resident applications
- Standard authentication and security practices
- Typical performance expectations for mobile-first applications

The specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` (if further refinement needed) or `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning.

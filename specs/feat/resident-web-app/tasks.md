# Tasks: Village Management Resident Web Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/feat/resident-web-app/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification. This task list focuses on implementation only.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P5).

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1-US9)
- Exact file paths included in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **App Routes**: `app/` (Next.js 15 App Router)
- **Components**: `components/` (ui/, forms/, features/, layout/)
- **Libraries**: `lib/` (supabase/, schemas/, hooks/, utils/, api/)
- **Types**: `types/` (TypeScript type definitions)
- **Constants**: `constants/` (application constants)
- **Stores**: `store/` (Zustand state management)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-11)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order: US1(P1) ‚Üí US2(P2) ‚Üí US3(P2) ‚Üí US4(P3) ‚Üí US5(P3) ‚Üí US6(P4) ‚Üí US7(P4) ‚Üí US8(P5) ‚Üí US9(P5)
- **Polish (Phase 12)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1) - Guests**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (P2) - Stickers**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US3 (P2) - Profile/History**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US4 (P3) - Announcements**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US5 (P3) - Payments**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US6 (P4) - Permits**: Can start after Foundational - May integrate with US5 (payments) but independently testable
- **US7 (P4) - Incidents**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US8 (P5) - Rules**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US9 (P5) - Messages**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Zod schemas before API functions (for validation)
- API functions before hooks (hooks use API functions)
- Hooks before components (components use hooks)
- Components before routes (routes use components)
- Core implementation before integration tasks
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: Tasks T002-T006, T008-T010, T012-T015 can run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:

- Database migrations T017-T022 can run in parallel
- Supabase clients T026-T027 can run in parallel after T025
- Stores T029-T030 can run in parallel after T028
- Hooks T032-T033 can run in parallel after T031
- Type definitions T035-T043 can run in parallel
- Utility functions T046-T047 can run in parallel
- Constants T049-T052 can run in parallel
- Base UI components T054-T059 can run in parallel
- Layout components T062-T064 can run in parallel
- Auth pages T067-T068 can run in parallel after T066

**User Stories (Phase 3-11)**: Once Foundational phase completes, all 9 user stories can start in parallel by different team members

**Within Each Story**: Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Guests)

```bash
# After T071 completes, launch API functions together:
Task T072: "Create getHouseholdGuests function in lib/api/guests.ts"
Task T073: "Create createGuest function in lib/api/guests.ts"
Task T074: "Create updateGuest function in lib/api/guests.ts"
Task T075: "Create cancelGuest function in lib/api/guests.ts"
Task T076: "Create bulkCreateGuests function in lib/api/guests.ts"

# After T077 completes, launch components together:
Task T078: "Create GuestForm component in components/forms/GuestForm.tsx"
Task T079: "Create GuestList component in components/features/guests/GuestList.tsx"
Task T080: "Create GuestStatusBadge component in components/features/guests/GuestStatusBadge.tsx"

# After T082 completes, launch route pages together:
Task T083: "Create new guest page in app/(dashboard)/guests/new/page.tsx"
Task T084: "Create edit guest page in app/(dashboard)/guests/[id]/edit/page.tsx"
Task T085: "Create guest details page in app/(dashboard)/guests/[id]/page.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T015)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T016-T070) - CRITICAL, blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Guests (T071-T088)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test guest pre-authorization flow independently
5. Deploy/demo MVP

**Estimated MVP**: ~88 tasks for core guest management functionality

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (T001-T070)
2. Add US1 (Guests) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add US2 (Stickers) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add US3 (Profile/History) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add US4 (Announcements) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add US5 (Payments) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Add US6 (Permits) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
8. Add US7 (Incidents) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
9. Add US8 (Rules) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
10. Add US9 (Messages) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
11. Polish & Production (T223-T242)

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T070)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: US1 (Guests) - Priority P1
   - **Developer B**: US2 (Stickers) - Priority P2
   - **Developer C**: US3 (Profile/History) - Priority P2
   - **Developer D**: US4 (Announcements) - Priority P3
   - **Developer E**: US5 (Payments) - Priority P3
3. Higher priority stories (P1-P2) complete first
4. Stories integrate and test independently
5. Team collaborates on Polish phase

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 242 tasks across 12 phases

**Breakdown by Phase**:

- Phase 1 (Setup): 15 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 55 tasks
- Phase 3 (US1 - Guests): 18 tasks
- Phase 4 (US2 - Stickers): 21 tasks
- Phase 5 (US3 - Profile/History): 15 tasks
- Phase 6 (US4 - Announcements): 15 tasks
- Phase 7 (US5 - Payments): 17 tasks
- Phase 8 (US6 - Permits): 19 tasks
- Phase 9 (US7 - Incidents): 17 tasks
- Phase 10 (US8 - Rules): 11 tasks
- Phase 11 (US9 - Messages): 16 tasks
- Phase 12 (Polish): 20 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 140+ tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases

**Independent Test Criteria**: Each user story (US1-US9) has clear test criteria for independent validation

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (US1 - Guest Pre-Authorization) = 88 tasks

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [Story] label (US1-US9) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Tests are NOT included (not explicitly requested in spec)
- snake_case ‚Üí camelCase transformation required for all Supabase data
- All file paths follow Next.js 15 App Router structure
- DaisyUI v5 classes used for styling (no custom Tailwind config file needed)
- Mobile-first approach: test on 320px breakpoint first
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory for all components
- Zero TypeScript `any` types allowed per constitution
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding

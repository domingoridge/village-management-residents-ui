## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Guest Pre-Authorization (Priority: P1)

As a household head or member, I want to pre-register guests before they arrive so that they can enter smoothly without delays at the gate, and I can approve walk-in guests remotely when I'm not home.

**Why this priority**: Guest management is the most frequently used feature and directly impacts daily resident experience. Pre-authorization reduces gate wait times and provides convenience for busy residents who can't always answer calls from guards.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a guest pre-registration, verifying it appears in the upcoming guests list, simulating guard notification for walk-in guest approval, and confirming guest status updates are reflected in the system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in as a household head, **When** I fill out the guest pre-registration form with name, expected arrival date, and vehicle plate number, **Then** the guest is added to my upcoming guests list with "Pending" status
2. **Given** I have a pre-authorized guest, **When** the guest arrives at the gate, **Then** I receive a notification and the guest status updates to "At Gate"
3. **Given** I receive a walk-in guest notification from the guard, **When** I approve the guest within 5 minutes, **Then** the guard is notified and the guest is allowed entry
4. **Given** I receive a walk-in guest notification, **When** I do not respond within 5 minutes, **Then** the request auto-denies and the guard is notified
5. **Given** I have upcoming guests, **When** I cancel a guest before their arrival, **Then** the guest is removed from active guests and guards are notified
6. **Given** I search my guest history, **When** I filter by date range or guest name, **Then** I see only matching guest records

---

### User Story 2 - Vehicle Sticker Management (Priority: P2)

As a household head or member, I want to request vehicle stickers for my household vehicles and track their status, renewal, and expiration so that my vehicles can access the village without issues.

**Why this priority**: Vehicle stickers are essential for regular village access. This feature enables self-service sticker requests and reduces administrative burden while ensuring residents stay compliant with sticker requirements.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting a sticker request with vehicle details and documents, tracking the application status through the approval workflow, viewing all household stickers with their expiration dates, and requesting renewal for an expiring sticker.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in as a household head, **When** I submit a sticker request with vehicle type, plate number, make/model, color, and upload OR/CR documents, **Then** the sticker request is created with "Pending" status
2. **Given** I have submitted a sticker request, **When** an admin approves it, **Then** the sticker appears in my sticker list with "Active" status and expiration date
3. **Given** I have an active sticker expiring in 30 days, **When** I view my sticker list, **Then** I see an expiry warning and a "Renew" button is available
4. **Given** I click the renew button on an expiring sticker, **When** I submit the renewal request with updated information, **Then** a new renewal request is created
5. **Given** I view my sticker list, **When** I check sticker details, **Then** I can see assigned user, vehicle details, violation count, and expiration countdown
6. **Given** my sticker is suspended, **When** I view the sticker details, **Then** I see the suspension status, reason, and violation history

---

### User Story 3 - Household Profile and Access History (Priority: P2)

As a household head or member, I want to view my household information, member list, and entry/exit history so that I can monitor household activity and understand who is accessing the village under my household.

**Why this priority**: Transparency into household access provides security and accountability. This foundational feature supports all other features by giving residents visibility into their household status and activity.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing household profile with member list and sticker quota, filtering access history by date range and vehicle, and verifying that all household entries and exits are logged correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I view my household profile, **Then** I see household code, address, household head information, resident list, and sticker quota usage
2. **Given** I view my access history, **When** I filter by date range, **Then** I see all entry/exit logs for household vehicles within that range
3. **Given** I view my access history, **When** I filter by specific vehicle (sticker), **Then** I see only logs for that vehicle
4. **Given** I am a household member, **When** I view access logs, **Then** I see entry type (Resident, Guest, Delivery, Construction), gate location, and timestamp
5. **Given** I am a beneficial user, **When** I view my access history, **Then** I see only my personal access logs, not the entire household's
6. **Given** I need to update contact information, **When** I edit my phone number or email, **Then** my profile is updated and I receive a confirmation

---

### User Story 4 - Announcements and Village Updates (Priority: P3)

As any resident user, I want to view village announcements, filter by type, and receive notifications for urgent updates so that I stay informed about events, maintenance, emergencies, and rule changes.

**Why this priority**: Communication is vital for community engagement and safety. Announcements keep residents informed without requiring active outreach from administration.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing the announcement feed, filtering by type (Event, Emergency, Maintenance), marking announcements as read, receiving notifications for new urgent announcements, and viewing announcement attachments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I view the announcements feed, **Then** I see announcements in reverse chronological order with type, priority, and read/unread status
2. **Given** there are multiple announcement types, **When** I filter by "Emergency", **Then** I see only emergency announcements
3. **Given** a new urgent announcement is published, **When** I have notifications enabled, **Then** I receive an immediate notification
4. **Given** I view an unread announcement, **When** I open the announcement details, **Then** the announcement is marked as read
5. **Given** an announcement has attachments, **When** I view the announcement details, **Then** I can view images and PDF attachments
6. **Given** I want to share an announcement, **When** I click the share button, **Then** I can share the announcement via web share API or copy the link

---

### User Story 5 - Payments and Billing (Priority: P3)

As a household head or member, I want to view my payment history, outstanding balances, and make online payments so that I can conveniently pay association fees, road fees, and other charges without visiting the office.

**Why this priority**: Online payments provide convenience and reduce payment friction. This feature improves cash flow for the village and provides residents with transparency into their financial obligations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing the payment dashboard with outstanding balance, filtering payment history by status and type, initiating an online payment, and downloading a receipt after successful payment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I view the payment dashboard, **Then** I see total outstanding balance, upcoming due payments, and recent payment history
2. **Given** I have outstanding payments, **When** I filter by "Overdue", **Then** I see only overdue payments with amounts and due dates
3. **Given** I select a payment to pay, **When** I choose a payment method (GCash, Credit Card, PayMaya) and complete the transaction, **Then** payment is processed and I receive a confirmation notification
4. **Given** I complete a payment, **When** I view my payment history, **Then** the payment appears with "Paid" status and I can download the receipt as PDF
5. **Given** I have a payment due in 7 days, **When** the due date approaches, **Then** I receive a payment reminder notification
6. **Given** I view payment breakdown, **When** I check payment types, **Then** I see categorized amounts for Association Fee, Road Fee, Sticker Fee, and Penalties

---

### User Story 6 - Construction Permit Application (Priority: P4)

As a household head or member, I want to submit construction permit applications with required documents, track approval status, and pay road fees so that I can legally conduct construction work in my property.

**Why this priority**: While less frequent than daily operations, construction permits are important for compliance and preventing illegal construction. This feature streamlines the application process.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting a permit application with project description, contractor details, dates, and documents, tracking the approval status, viewing calculated road fees, and paying fees online.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want to apply for a construction permit, **When** I submit the application form with project description, contractor name/contact, proposed start/end dates, and upload blueprints and contracts, **Then** the permit application is created with "Pending" status
2. **Given** I have a pending permit application, **When** the admin approves it, **Then** I receive a notification, the status updates to "Approved", and calculated road fee is displayed
3. **Given** my permit is approved with road fees, **When** I pay the road fee online, **Then** the payment is recorded and the permit status updates to "In Progress"
4. **Given** my permit application is rejected, **When** I view the permit details, **Then** I see the rejection reason and can resubmit if needed
5. **Given** I have an active permit, **When** I view permit details, **Then** I see timeline of status changes, payment status, and permit conditions
6. **Given** my permit is nearing expiration, **When** the expiration date approaches, **Then** I receive a reminder notification

---

### User Story 7 - Incident Reporting (Priority: P4)

As any resident user, I want to report incidents or suspicious activities with photos and location details so that security and administration can respond quickly to safety concerns.

**Why this priority**: Safety and security reporting is critical but less frequent than daily operations. Quick reporting mechanisms encourage residents to report issues promptly.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting an incident report with type, description, location, photos, and severity, tracking the incident status, receiving status update notifications, and viewing resolution notes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I witness an incident, **When** I submit an incident report with type (Security Threat, Traffic Violation, Noise Complaint), title, description, location, photos, and severity, **Then** the incident is created with "Reported" status
2. **Given** I submit an incident report, **When** a guard acknowledges it, **Then** I receive an acknowledgment notification and the status updates to "Acknowledged"
3. **Given** my incident is being handled, **When** the status changes to "In Progress" or "Resolved", **Then** I receive status update notifications
4. **Given** my incident is resolved, **When** I view the incident details, **Then** I see assigned guard information, resolution notes, and timeline of updates
5. **Given** I want to report anonymously, **When** I check the "Submit anonymously" option, **Then** my identity is not disclosed to guards
6. **Given** I view my incident list, **When** I filter by status or type, **Then** I see only matching incidents

---

### User Story 8 - Village Rules and Regulations (Priority: P5)

As any resident user, I want to view village rules, search for specific regulations, and receive notifications when rules change so that I understand my obligations and avoid violations.

**Why this priority**: Rules awareness helps residents comply and avoid penalties. This is a reference feature used occasionally rather than daily.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing categorized rules list, searching for specific rules by keyword, filtering by category, viewing rule details with penalties, and receiving notifications for new or updated rules.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want to understand village rules, **When** I view the rules list, **Then** I see rules categorized by type (Curfew, Speed Limit, Parking, Noise, Construction Hours, Pet Policy)
2. **Given** I need specific rule information, **When** I search for a keyword, **Then** I see all rules matching that keyword
3. **Given** I view a rule, **When** I open the rule details, **Then** I see full rule text, effective date, penalty information, and related documents
4. **Given** a rule is updated or added, **When** I view the rules list, **Then** I see a "New" or "Updated" badge on changed rules
5. **Given** a new urgent rule is published, **When** notifications are enabled, **Then** I receive a notification about the rule change
6. **Given** I want to view rule documents, **When** I click on a rule with attachments, **Then** I can view PDF documents in the browser

---

### User Story 9 - Communication with Administration (Priority: P5)

As a household head or member, I want to send messages to village administration, attach photos or documents, and receive responses so that I can get assistance without visiting the office.

**Why this priority**: Direct communication channel improves resident satisfaction but is less urgent than operational features. Most issues can be handled through other features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending a message to admin with category and attachments, viewing conversation history, receiving admin replies, and getting notifications for new responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I need to contact administration, **When** I compose a message with category (General Inquiry, Complaint, Request, Feedback) and optional attachments, **Then** the message is sent to admin
2. **Given** I have sent messages, **When** I view conversation history, **Then** I see threaded conversations with timestamps
3. **Given** admin replies to my message, **When** the reply is received, **Then** I get a notification and see an unread badge
4. **Given** I receive an admin reply, **When** I open the conversation, **Then** the unread indicator is cleared
5. **Given** I want to attach evidence, **When** I add photos or documents to my message, **Then** attachments are uploaded and visible to admin

# Specification Quality Checklist: Dashboard Route Protection

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All validation items have been verified:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification is written in plain language without framework-specific details (Next.js, React) or implementation specifics. It focuses on the security requirement and user experience.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 8 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No clarification markers were needed as the feature scope is clear - protect dashboard routes with authentication.

3. **Success Criteria**: All 5 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
   - SC-001: 100% redirect rate (measurable)
   - SC-002: 0% unexpected redirects (measurable)
   - SC-003: <100ms authentication check (measurable performance)
   - SC-004: 95% successful post-login redirects (measurable UX)
   - SC-005: Zero security incidents (measurable security)

4. **Feature Readiness**: The spec includes 3 prioritized user stories (P1-P3), each independently testable with clear acceptance scenarios. Dependencies and assumptions are documented.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed - the security requirement is straightforward
- All edge cases identified for implementation consideration

# Feature Specification: Dashboard Route Protection

**Feature Branch**: `fix/protected-routes`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "dashboard route group should be protected, if unauthenticated should redirect to login page"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Unauthenticated Access Prevention (Priority: P1)

When an unauthenticated user attempts to access any dashboard route, they should be immediately redirected to the login page to ensure secure access to protected content.

**Why this priority**: This is the core security requirement that prevents unauthorized access to dashboard features. Without this, sensitive user data and functionality would be exposed to anyone who knows the URL.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to access any dashboard route without valid authentication credentials and verifying the redirect to the login page occurs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access any dashboard route directly via URL, **Then** they are immediately redirected to the login page
2. **Given** a user is not logged in, **When** they navigate to the root dashboard path, **Then** they are redirected to the login page before any dashboard content loads
3. **Given** a user's session has expired, **When** they try to access a dashboard route, **Then** they are redirected to the login page

### User Story 2 - Authenticated Access Allowance (Priority: P2)

When an authenticated user attempts to access dashboard routes, they should be granted access without redirection, allowing them to use the dashboard features seamlessly.

**Why this priority**: This ensures that legitimate users can access the dashboard after successful authentication, completing the user flow.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in with valid credentials and then accessing various dashboard routes to confirm no unexpected redirects occur.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logged in with valid credentials, **When** they navigate to any dashboard route, **Then** they can access the route without being redirected
2. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they refresh a dashboard page, **Then** they remain on that page without redirection
3. **Given** a user has an active session, **When** they navigate between different dashboard routes, **Then** they move freely without authentication prompts

### User Story 3 - Return to Intended Destination (Priority: P3)

When an unauthenticated user is redirected to the login page, the system should remember the originally requested dashboard route and redirect them there after successful authentication.

**Why this priority**: This enhances user experience by eliminating the need for users to manually navigate back to their intended destination after login.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing a specific dashboard route while unauthenticated, completing login, and verifying the redirect to the originally requested route.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user attempts to access a specific dashboard route while unauthenticated, **When** they successfully log in, **Then** they are redirected to the originally requested route
2. **Given** a user is redirected to login from a dashboard route, **When** they cancel the login attempt, **Then** the intended route information is preserved for future login attempts

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's session expires while they are actively using the dashboard?
- How does the system handle deep-linked dashboard URLs shared by authenticated users with unauthenticated recipients?
- What happens if the login page itself is requested while already authenticated?
- How does the system handle simultaneous login attempts from multiple devices or tabs?
- What happens when a user bookmarks a dashboard route and tries to access it after their session expires?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST intercept all requests to dashboard routes and verify authentication status before granting access
- **FR-002**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated users to the login page when they attempt to access any dashboard route
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow authenticated users to access all dashboard routes without redirection
- **FR-004**: System MUST detect expired sessions and treat them as unauthenticated
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve the originally requested URL when redirecting unauthenticated users to login
- **FR-006**: System MUST redirect users to their originally requested dashboard route after successful authentication
- **FR-007**: System MUST apply route protection to all current and future routes within the dashboard route group
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle authentication checks efficiently without noticeable delay for end users

### Key Entities

- **User Session**: Represents the authentication state of a user, including authentication status, session validity, and expiration time
- **Protected Route**: A dashboard route that requires authentication, including the route path and access requirements
- **Redirect Target**: The originally requested URL that an unauthenticated user attempted to access, preserved for post-login navigation

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated access attempts to dashboard routes result in redirect to login page
- **SC-002**: 0% of authenticated users experience unexpected redirects when accessing dashboard routes
- **SC-003**: Authentication check completes in under 100 milliseconds to avoid noticeable delay
- **SC-004**: 95% of users who are redirected to login are successfully redirected to their intended destination after authentication
- **SC-005**: Zero unauthorized access incidents to dashboard routes in security testing

## Assumptions _(mandatory)_

- An authentication system and login page already exist in the application
- The application has a clear definition of what constitutes the "dashboard route group"
- Session management is already implemented and can be queried to determine authentication status
- The application framework supports middleware or route guards for implementing access control

## Dependencies _(optional)_

- Existing authentication system must be functional
- Login page must be accessible and operational
- Session management system must accurately reflect user authentication status

## Out of Scope _(optional)_

- Implementation of the login functionality itself
- User registration or password reset features
- Role-based access control within the dashboard (all authenticated users are treated equally)
- API endpoint protection (this focuses only on route-level protection)
- Multi-factor authentication requirements
